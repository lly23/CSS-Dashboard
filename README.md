CSS Dashboard Project for MEJO 487

Assignment Specs:

Requirements:

All text must be real text. No images.
The app must be responsive. You may use CSS Grid, FlexBox, and/or Bootstrap. I will view the app on mobile and desktop.
Navigation roll-overs must work (e.g., the icons change color)
Links, hover, visited and active must work; use dummy links (#)
The JavaScript features do not have to work (e.g., the tooltip does not need to appear when you hover on the donut chart)
The graph in the middle can be an image, but the forms (e.g. the dropdown menu and radio buttons) must be created in HTML and work properly 
The bottom three banner ads must consist of images inside HTML divs, not simply images of the entire ads
Use CSS sprites for most of the graphics in the app. Export the images from the Photoshop layers and use them to make your sprite sheet. Notice that some of the menus have hover states (e.g., the top icon nav and the social media nav in the footer), so you'll need to export the two versions of each icon and put them in your sprite sheet so you can have hover states in your app.
Pay attention to the details while keeping an eye on the deadline. Don't spend too much time on one design element at the expense of finishing the project as a whole. 
Purpose:
Strengthen your CSS skills by tackling new challenges. This project may require some CSS techniques you have not used before; that's the whole point. Figuring out how to create this design on your own is the challenge, and knowledge is the reward. You can solve almost any coding problem through Googling, stack overflow, and other online resources. In the past, the students who have toughed it out on their own have found it to be a very empowering experience.

Grading:
Matching the desktop specs (50%) - All of the HTML and CSS features are represented in the app and work as indicated in the design.
Responsive design (30%) - The mobile interface looks good and works well. The layout is user-friendly and meets industry standards (e.g., the touch target areas are large enough; refer to the Layout Considerations in Apple's Human Interface Guidelines).
Legibility of code (20%) - Code is clean, efficient, and well-commented.

Note: the purple 'ripple' effect when I click the checkboxes is just part of the screencast cues; it's not part of the app design.

Submission:
Upload your project onto your web server and push all of the code to GitHub. Submit the two links (the live app and the Git Hub repo) here in Sakai. For example:
